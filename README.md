- 👋 Hi, I’m @SiawashTheDigitalDesigner
- 👀 I’m interested in Digital Design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FPGA based project

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ## ⚡ Fun Facts:

Level Up!  Mastered the art of Electrical Power and Electronics with a shiny Master's degree. Now I'm on a quest to conquer the world of FPGAs (one line of code at a time)!

Certified Cool:  Boast three fancy FPGA certifications because who doesn't love a little extra cred?

Speed Freak (But the Good Kind):  My code may not win a drag race, but I can design hardware that makes yours a champion! ➡️

Bug Slayer Supreme:  Testing and debugging are my kryptonite... except I actually enjoy them!  Consider me your friendly neighborhood code doctor.

Chip Whisperer (嘘):  Xilinx chips hold no secrets for me.  (Just promise you won't tell them I can talk to them.)

Code Archaeologist:  Translating and documenting ancient (well, maybe not that old) FPGA code is a breeze.  Indiana Jones has nothing on me!

BOM Bonanza!  Creating BOMs and Timing reports is like playing a strategic board game... except with numbers and parts.  (Still way more fun than doing your taxes!)

DSP Decoder Ring:  FIR, IIR, FFT?  These DSP heroes are just a few of the algorithms I can bring to life with FPGA!   (Think of me as your personal signal processing superhero!)

MATLAB Mystery Solver:  VHDL code got you stumped?  Fear not!  I can team up with MATLAB to crack the case! ️‍♀️
