- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ## ⚡ Fun Facts:

**Master of My Domain (Literally):** I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Power and Electronics, so you can say I'm wired for success (pun intended)! 

**Triple Threat:**  I'm not just a code slinger, I'm also certified in FPGA! Think of me as the Bruce Lee of hardware design.   (Although hopefully less prone to flying kicks )

**Speed Demon:** I'm a pro at designing optimized hardware architectures for high data rates. Basically, I make your code go zoom! ️ 

**From Bugs to Brags:**  Testing, debugging, and using measurement devices is my jam. I turn coding headaches into coding high-fives!  🪲➡️

**Chip Whisperer:**  I speak fluent Xilinx and can tame even the wildest IP cores.   (Don't tell the chips )

**Code Diplomat:**  I can translate and document FPGA code with the accuracy of a seasoned diplomat.   (Though hopefully without the political drama!)

**BOM Bonanza:**  Creating precise BOMs and Timing reports from FPGA is child's play for me.   (Just like counting candy!)

**MATLAB Maestro:** Combining my FPGA skills with MATLAB? Don't mind if I do!    (Just call me the VHDL code validator extraordinaire!)

**DSP Decoder:**  Familiar with DSP? You bet! Just another language in my ever-growing coding arsenal.
